How to Run
----------
Execute `run.sh` with the path to the .c file containing the function you want to optimize. Exclude the file extension.
Eg. to run it for `tests/grimfilter.c` run

./run.sh tests/grimfilter

It writes an `out.bc` in the project root as output, this can be disassembled via llvm-dis to see the inserted PIM functions.
